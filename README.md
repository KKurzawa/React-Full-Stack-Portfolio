# React-Full-Stack-Portfolio

## Description

A professional portfolio for Kris Kurzawa built with React and deployed with Netlify.  This portfolio has About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume links, as well as links to Kris' Github, LinkedIn, and Stack Overflow profiles.  

## Usage

Upon clicking on the site the user is presented with a page with a picture/bio of Kris Kurzawa.  The navbar has links to the following pages: About Me(homepage), Portfolio, Contact, and Resume.  The footer displays icons/links to Kris Kurzawa's Github portfolio, LinkedIn profile, and Stack Overflow page.  The navbar and footer appear on each of the site's pages.  Once the user clicks on the portfolio link they can view screenshots of six of Kris' recent projects with links to the sites and Github Repositories.  Once the user clicks on the contact me link they are presented to a form in which they can enter their name, email, subject for an email, and a message.  If the email entry does not include a proper email syntax a prompt alerts the user to do so.  Once the user clicks the Submit button text boxes are cleared and an email is sent to my email account from the entered email.  Once the user clicks on the resume link they view a button to download Kris' resume, along with icons representing Kris' technical skills.  Each icon is a link to the corresponding website.
